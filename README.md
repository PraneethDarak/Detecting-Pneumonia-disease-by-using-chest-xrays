# Creating a model that detects Pneumonia by using chest xrays
# AI in Healthcare
  AI in healthcare will always be the reason I started to dig in this field of Artificial Intelligence. The scope is huge and the impact you make in the world, too. Making a prototype to solve medical problems will always be a reason to be proud of.
  
It’s unbelievable how AI is improving the healthcare field, specifically in medical diagnosis. AI will improve the way Doctors diagnose and treat diseases. It’s not a competition but an opportunity to join forces!

This time, detecting Pneumonia in Chest X-Ray images, is a great experience. I will show you two ways to detect Pneumonia in Chest X-Rays: Using a Convolutional Neural Network with Tensorflow..
# What is Pneumonia?
  According to the American Lung Association, Pneumonia is an infection that inflames your lungs’ air sacs (alveoli). The air sacs may fill up with fluid or pus, causing symptoms such as a cough, fever, chills and trouble breathing.
# Pneumonia Symptoms
Most common Pneumonia symptoms are:

Cough, which may produce greenish, yellow or even bloody mucus
Fever, sweating and shaking chills
Shortness of breath
Rapid, shallow breathing
Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough
Loss of appetite, low energy, and fatigue
Nausea and vomiting, especially in small children
Confusion, especially in older people
# Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)
I will use the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset. You can find this dataset at Kaggle. It’s organized into 3 folders (train, test and val sets) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

I will upload the images and tag them into 2 categories: Normal and Pneumonia.

# Instructions
The project is broken down into multiple steps:

Load and preprocess the image dataset
.Train the image classifier on your dataset
.Use the trained classifier to predict image content.
Everything you need to recreate this project is on the jupyter notebook.
